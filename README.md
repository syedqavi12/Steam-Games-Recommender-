# Steam-Games-Recommender

Group Project for Recommender Systems Class

### Description

steam_merge: Final dataset used for the Project

SVDpp_analysis: Contains the Python Code and results for SVDpp algorithm, Accuracy measures, Cluster analysis

Data_Exploration_Wrangling: Contains the code for data exploration 

Final Report: Overall summary of the group findings and results

### Overview

Goal for this project is to optimize recommendation algorithms for use on the Steam dataset. The dataset consisted of selection of game reviews from Australian Steam users and user, item data and merged with the version one of the game reviews with the user and item data into the file steam_merge.csv. Surprise packageâ€™s implementation of several different algorithms (SVDpp, Cluster Analysis) and optimized their parameters with a grid search and calculate accuracy measures (Precision, Recall, F1 Score).
